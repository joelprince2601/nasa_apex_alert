Executive Summary
Project Overview
This project addresses the critical need for shark habitat protection by developing a predictive mathematical framework that identifies shark foraging hotspots using NASA satellite data. By correlating oceanographic parameters visible from space with shark movement patterns, we enable data-driven conservation strategies and improved coastal management.
Key Innovations
* Mathematical predictive model linking satellite-observed environmental factors to shark foraging behavior
* Multi-parameter correlation analysis combining chlorophyll concentration, sea surface temperature, and ocean currents
* Next-generation smart tag concept that tracks not only location but also feeding behavior in real-time
* Accessible visualization platform for stakeholders from conservation organizations to coastal communities
Challenge Addressed
Sharks are apex predators facing unprecedented fishing pressure. Traditional tracking methods only show where sharks are, not why they're there or what they're eating. Our solution bridges the gap between space-based ocean observation and marine predator behavior, enabling proactive habitat protection.

Problem Statement
Background
* 73 million sharks are killed annually through fishing and bycatch
* 25% of shark species are threatened with extinction
* Sharks regulate prey populations and maintain ecosystem balance
* Traditional tracking provides location data only, without ecological context
The Challenge
Satellites can easily detect phytoplankton (base of food web) but sharks are many trophic levels removed. The challenge is to:
1. Connect satellite-visible parameters to apex predator behavior
2. Predict foraging hotspots before sharks arrive
3. Enable real-time tracking of what sharks are eating, not just where they are
4. Create actionable data for conservation and coastal management
Why It Matters
* Conservation: Identify critical habitats for protection
* Safety: Better predict shark presence for coastal communities
* Science: Understand ocean health through apex predator indicators
* Sustainability: Support coexistence between human activities and marine ecosystems

Methodology
Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing
1.1 Satellite Data Acquisition
python
# Pseudocode for data acquisition
def acquire_satellite_data(region, start_date, end_date):
    pace_data = download_pace_chlorophyll(region, start_date, end_date)
    modis_data = download_modis_sst(region, start_date, end_date)
    swot_data = download_swot_currents(region, start_date, end_date)
    
    return pace_data, modis_data, swot_data
1.2 Data Cleaning
* Remove cloud-contaminated pixels
* Fill gaps using spatial-temporal interpolation
* Standardize coordinate systems (WGS84)
* Normalize units across datasets
1.3 Spatial-Temporal Alignment
* Resample all data to common grid (e.g., 0.1� � 0.1�)
* Align temporal resolution (daily or weekly composites)
* Create matched dataset where all parameters overlap

Phase 2: Feature Engineering
2.1 Environmental Features
From satellite data, we extract:
Chlorophyll Features:
* Absolute concentration
* Temporal gradient (rate of change)
* Spatial gradient (bloom edges)
* Persistence (days above threshold)
Temperature Features:
* Absolute SST
* Temperature fronts (sharp gradients)
* Deviation from climatology
* Thermal stability index
Current Features:
* Current velocity magnitude
* Direction variability
* Convergence/divergence zones
* Eddy kinetic energy
2.2 Derived Ecological Indices
Primary Productivity Index = f(Chlorophyll, Light, Temperature)
Foraging Habitat Suitability = f(Temp_optimal, Prey_abundance_proxy)
Oceanographic Complexity = f(Current_variance, Front_strength)

Phase 3: Model Development
3.1 Training Dataset Preparation
* Input Features: Environmental parameters from satellite data (X)
* Target Variable: Shark presence/absence or foraging probability (Y)
* Temporal Split: Train on 2004-2020, validate on 2021-2023, test on 2024
3.2 Model Architecture
We employ an ensemble approach:
Primary Model: Random Forest Classifier
python
# Pseudocode
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=500,
    max_depth=20,
    min_samples_split=10,
    class_weight='balanced'
)

model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Why Random Forest:
* Handles non-linear relationships
* Provides feature importance rankings
* Robust to outliers
* Interpretable results
Alternative Models Tested:
* Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
* Neural Networks (LSTM for temporal patterns)
* Support Vector Machines
3.3 Model Training Process

2. Apply cross-validation (k-fold, k=5)
3. Hyperparameter tuning using grid search
4. Feature selection based on importance
5. Model evaluation using multiple metrics
3.4 Evaluation Metrics
* Accuracy: Overall correctness
* Precision: Minimize false positives (predicting sharks when absent)
* Recall: Minimize false negatives (missing actual shark presence)
* F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
* AUC-ROC: Model's discrimination ability

Phase 4: Prediction Generation
4.1 Real-Time Forecasting
python
# Pseudocode for prediction
def predict_shark_hotspots(current_date, forecast_days=30):
    # Get latest satellite data
    env_data = get_current_environmental_conditions(current_date)
    
    # Generate predictions
    probabilities = model.predict_proba(env_data)
    
    # Create spatial maps
    hotspot_map = generate_heatmap(probabilities, threshold=0.7)
    
    return hotspot_map
4.2 Output Format
* Heat maps: Color-coded probability surfaces
* GeoJSON: For web mapping applications
* Tabular data: CSV with coordinates and probabilities
* Time series: Predicted hotspot evolution over forecast period

Hardware Innovation
Smart Shark Tag Concept
Current Limitations
Existing shark tags provide:
* GPS location only
* Basic depth information
* Limited battery life (months to 1-2 years)
* No feeding behavior data
Our Enhanced Design
Tag Specifications:
Physical Design:
??? Dimensions: 12cm � 4cm � 3cm (streamlined)
??? Weight: 80g (in air), neutrally buoyant
??? Attachment: Dorsal fin mount or surgical implant
??? Duration: 2-3 years operational life

Sensors:
??? GPS Module: Location when surfacing
??? Pressure Sensor: Depth profiling (0-1000m)
??? Temperature Sensors (�2):
?   ??? External: Ambient water temperature
?   ??? Internal: Proximity sensor for stomach temp
??? 3-Axis Accelerometer: Movement and feeding detection
??? Magnetometer: Heading and orientation
??? Conductivity Sensor: Salinity (optional)

Communication:
??? Satellite Uplink: Argos or Iridium system
??? Transmission Frequency: Every surfacing event
??? Data Bandwidth: ~1KB per transmission
??? Real-time relay to cloud servers

Power System:
??? Lithium battery pack
??? Low-power sleep modes
??? Solar cell supplement (for surface time)
??? Capacitor for burst transmissions
Key Innovation: Feeding Detection
How It Works:
1. Accelerometer Pattern Recognition: 
o Detect sudden burst swimming (pursuit)
o Identify characteristic jaw-snap motion
o Recognize post-feeding rest periods
2. Temperature Correlation: 
o Monitor stomach temperature changes
o Cold-blooded prey causes temp drop
o Timing correlates with accelerometer events
3. Behavioral Algorithm:
python
# Simplified feeding detection logic
def detect_feeding_event(accel_data, temp_data, timestamp):
    burst_swim = detect_acceleration_spike(accel_data)
    jaw_motion = detect_feeding_pattern(accel_data)
    temp_drop = detect_stomach_temp_change(temp_data)
    
    if burst_swim and jaw_motion and temp_drop:
        return FeedingEvent(
            timestamp=timestamp,
            location=get_gps_fix(),
            water_temp=temp_data['external'],
            confidence=calculate_confidence([burst_swim, jaw_motion, temp_drop])
        )
Data Transmitted
Each surfacing transmission includes:
json
{
  "tag_id": "SHARK_001",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-05T14:30:00Z",
  "location": {"lat": 35.5, "lon": -75.2},
  "depth_profile": [0, -50, -120, -200, -120, -50, 0],
  "temperature": {"surface": 24.5, "max_depth": 12.3},
  "feeding_events": [
    {
      "time": "2025-10-05T10:15:00Z",
      "depth": -85,
      "confidence": 0.89
    }
  ],
  "battery_level": 78
}
Benefits Over Current Technology
* Ecological context: Know what sharks eat, not just where they go
* Real-time data: Immediate transmission vs. tag recovery
* Model improvement: Feeding data validates and refines predictions
* Research value: Unprecedented dietary insights
* Conservation impact: Protect areas where sharks actually hunt
